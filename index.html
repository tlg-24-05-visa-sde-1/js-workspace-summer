      <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz">
        Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American
        communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the late 19th and early 20th
        centuries, with its roots in blues, ragtime, European harmony and
        African rhythmic rituals.Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been
        recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and
        popular music.
